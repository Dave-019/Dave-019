# Hey, I'm David!

I'm a data engineer, web dev, and bug bounty hunter from Kenya. I break things on the internet (in a good way, promise) and build cool stuff with code. Right now, I'm deep into Vue, Nuxt, and exploring the wonders of cloud tech (mainly Google Cloud). If you want to collaborate or just chat about tech, hit me up!

## What I Work With

- **Data Engineering** – I make sense of messy data and build pipelines to turn chaos into gold.
- **Web Development** – I’m all about clean, functional web apps, especially with Vue and Nuxt.
- **Cloud Stuff** – Google Cloud, Docker… if it’s in the cloud, I’m probably messing with it.
- **Bug Bounties** – Ethical hacking because breaking things the right way is fun.

## What’s in the Repo?

You’ll find some of my personal projects, experiments, and maybe even a few things that broke along the way (but hey, that’s how we learn). Feel free to check out my repositories for random coolness!

## Let’s Connect

Want to collaborate or just talk tech? Open an issue or drop me a message. I’m always down to learn or share ideas!
