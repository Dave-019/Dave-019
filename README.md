# Welcome to My GitHub Profile  

Hey, I’m **David**. Just a regular guy who spends a ridiculous amount of time coding and messing around with tech. I’m into **data engineering**, **web development**, and finding bugs (intentionally, not the “oops” kind).  

## What I Actually Do  

- **Data Engineering**: Think SQL, Spark, Docker, and making data pipelines behave.  
- **Web Dev**: Vue, Nuxt, Tailwind—if it’s on the web and looks good, I’m probably into it.  
- **Bug Bounty Hunting**: Because breaking stuff is just… satisfying.  

## My Tech Toolbox  

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, PHP (yeah, still kicking).  
- **Tools**: Docker, Jenkins, Git—basically the “get stuff done” kit.  
- **Cloud**: GCP (where everything lives these days).  
- **Big Data**: Spark (because who doesn’t like playing with massive datasets?).  
- **Data Viz**: Plotly, Power BI (turning numbers into something people *actually* get).  
- **Databases**: SQL (I talk to databases more than people).  

## Where to Find Me  

- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwangi-david-6b279a2b4/)**  
- **[Twitter/X](https://x.com/DavidMwang976)**  
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/Dave-019)**  

Follow me, don’t follow me—it’s cool either way. I’ll still be here building stuff, breaking stuff, and making it all work again.
