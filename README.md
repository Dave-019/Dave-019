# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hey there, I'm **David**, a guy who's probably spent too many hours in front of a screen, but it's all for the greater good. I’m deep into **data engineering**, **web development**, and breaking stuff (bug bounty, of course).

## What I Do

- Data Engineering? You bet. SQL, Apache Spark, GCP, Docker—you name it.
- Web Development: Vue, Nuxt, and all that cool stuff that makes the web less boring.
- Bug Bounty: Because finding bugs is way more fun than squashing them.
- **Roadmaps**: Check out my new repo for all the tech roadmaps you’ll ever need.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, PHP
- **Tools**: Docker, Jenkins, Git
- **Cloud**: GCP
- **Big Data**: Apache Spark
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Power BI
- **Databases**: SQL

## Current Projects

- **Roadmaps Repo**: Yeah, I made one. It's full of all the roadmaps you'll need to stop getting lost in tech.
